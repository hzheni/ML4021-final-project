Goal: The README helps others quickly understand your project. Keep it short, clear, and written for someone who has never seen your files before.
Use markdown headers to divide content.
Make an H2 (##) section explaining the contents of the repository

It must include two simple sections:
Section 1: Software and platform section
List the main tools needed to run your notebooks. For example:
Python version
Jupyter notebooks
Packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, PyTorch)
Operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
Section 2: A Map of your documentation.
In this section, you should provide an outline or tree illustrating the hierarchy of folders and subfolders contained in your Project Folder, and listing the files stored in each folder or subfolder.
